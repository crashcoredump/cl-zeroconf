* Synchronous versions of operations.

 This may make more sense for some (publishing) than for others
(browsing).  E.g, PUBLISH-SYNC could signal errors directly.
BROWSE-SYNC could take a timeout argument.  The advantage here would
be that it would make these operations slightly easier to use.


* Multicast DNS lookups of link-local addresses.  

OS X integrates multicast DNS lookups into its built-in resolver
system, so hostnames like "John-Wisemans-Computer.local" and
"dhcppc4.local" can be resolved normally.  Other operating systems
haven't integrated this yet (though I've read some things that implied
that Apple's Bonjour (nee rendezvous) installer hooked into NSS on
Windows).  I have a barebones QUERY-RECORD that can be used to do
these lookups, but maybe I should do a hostname lookup during the
RESOLVE operation.


* Windows support.

It should be very easy to get this code to work under Windows, but I
just haven't done it yet.


* Examples.

I really want to include some neat examples.  Crazy CLiki integration
(for use at ILCs?), distcc for Lisp, etc.


* Support for meta queries.

Whether this is an API issue or just an idiom, I'm not sure yet.


* Unicode/character-to-octet issues.

I barely even try to handle these.


* Threading.

It might be nice to at least describe how to use
PROCESS-DNS-SD-EVENTS, but better might be to actually set up an event
handling thread.  Or at least offer the option.

* Need to cancel RESOLVE ops?
